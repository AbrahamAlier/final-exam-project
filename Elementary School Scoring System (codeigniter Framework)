This project is created to fulfill the last assignment of Advanced Web Programming at JTI Polinema. This upload is the server side web app of the Elementary School Scoring System so, it means it's part of the entire project. The part of this project is available at https://github.com/pazcalll/Web-last-smt4/blob/master/README.md. This server side can handle almost the entire CRUD and export of the student score. the the excluded CRUD part can be found in the about link such as the entire list of the both student and teacher role.
